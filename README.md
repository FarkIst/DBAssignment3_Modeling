#### Review
* Does it solve the problem, and if not, explain why
  * It solves the problem and returns the amount of distinct users from the collection
* If you were able to get the queries to work in your setup (using a different programming language), and if not, what was the problem.
  * It returns an answer for the users, I did not compare my results with others, therefore the correctness is unknown
* Any suggestion from your own solution you would like to point out for inspiration
  * Most basic query found by a google search, easy to use. 
* If there was something in this solution which you envy
  * Simplicity

  * Returns the users that link to eachother the most, I assume it solves the problem.
* If you were able to get the queries to work in your setup (using a different programming language), and if not, what was the problem.
  * After a little testing the solution points that the result is correct.
